# Using phulp-server

A while ago, because of a design need, I created a PHP tool analogous to <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">GulpJS</a>, which I named from <a href="https://reisraff.github.io/phulp/" target="_blank">phulp</a>. The reasons for creating this tool are in this post: <a href="https://reisraff.github.io/me/en/post/1466448060" target="_blank">https://reisraff.github.io/me/en/post/1466448060</a>.

Lately, I had the need to have a "watcher" task, where, when updating a stack of defined files, a clousure is executed, and get the result of this clousure and serve in real time via HTTP. That is, so that I can follow the final result of the changes without having to build. For that, I implemented "watch" in phulp and created phulp-server which has the flexibility to be used in conjunction with phulp or standalone.

In designing Phulp-server I came across the problem of having to use threads and in general PHP builds don't have them by default. Using threads is what would do the magic of build and serve at the same time. To solve the problem, I resorted to <a href="http://reactphp.org/" target="_blank"> react-php </a>, where I can, through pipes, in my case receive the outputs from a command (in this case `php -S`), do something with this output, and perform some other task (in this case` watch`).

Phulp-server is dependent on `React\EventLoop\LoopInterface`. If your application uses React, you can also use phulp-server. Example of use:

Downloading with composer:

```bash
composer require reisraff/phulp-server
```

Writing the `phulpfile.php`:

```php
<?php

use Phulp\Server\Server;

$phulp->task('serve', function ($phulp) use ($config) {
    $server = new Server(
        [
            'address' => 'localhost',
            'port' => '8000',
            'router' => 'router.php',
            'path' => $config['project_path'],
        ],
        $phulp->getLoop() // here phulp returns the `LoopInterface`
    );
});
```

Running on terminal:

```bash
vendor/bin/phulp serve
```

Done ;)

As it is with react-php, you can have more than one instance of phulp-server.

# Automating tasks with PHING

This past week I went to <a href="http://phpexperience2016.imasters.com.br" target="_blank">PHP Experience</a> offered by  <a href="http://imasters.com.br/" target="_blank">iMasters</a>, and in one of the lectures I attended, I heard about automation, it's a common thing in the area of Informatics, especially by programmers, actually if you stop to think, work Being a programmer is nothing more than automating processes, and it's only fair to have a tool that helps programmers do this work by automating tests, builds, etc.

In this lecture I attended, <a href="https://twitter.com/hussanii" target="_blank">Hussani Oliveira</a> talked a little bit about it, some techniques that many people in this area and even uses it, and also talked about <a href="https://www.phing.info/" target="_blank">PHING</a> an automation tool written in <a href="http://php.net/" target="_blank">PHP</a> based on <a href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Ant</a>, I had heard of this tool before the lecture, but I had never used it, and I decided to use it, and because I found this tool very good I decided to write about it.

I created a project in Github with a simple example of how to use it, but I will make an overview.

As it is an Apache Ant based tool `build.xml` will exist as well, a small example would be:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<project name="phing-example-usage" basedir="." default="main">
    <property name="source" value="src" />
    <property name="bindir" value="bin" />
    <property name="appdir" value="app" />

    <target name="main" description="Start analyzing our application">
        <echo msg="Start Build" />

        <phingCall target="phplint" />
        <phingCall target="phpcs" />
        <phingCall target="phpunit" />

        <echo msg="Finished Build" />
    </target>

    <target name="phplint" description="Check syntax of a fileset of source files.">
        <phplint>
            <fileset dir="${source}">
                <include name="**/*.php"/>
            </fileset>
        </phplint>
    </target>

    <target name="phpcs" description="Coding Standards Analysis">
        <exec passthru="true" command="${bindir}/phpcs --standard=PSR2 ${source}" checkreturn="true" />
    </target>

    <target name="phpunit" description="Run unit tests using PHPUnit">
        <exec passthru="true" command="${bindir}/phpunit" checkreturn="true"/>
    </target>
</project>
```

We can set properties and even targets on the same idea as Apache Ant. And that's it, just this xml!

With this little xml, we automate 3 tasks that PHP programmers would have to do separately without this tool, in this case the syntax check we would do with `php -l`, the code style check we would do with `phpcs`, and running the tests. of unity we would do with `phpunit`.

I left the <a href="https://github.com/reisraff/phing-example-usage" target="_blank">full project</a> on Github if you want to play with it a little.

# Automating tasks with composer

In this post I will not go deep into how the composer works with scripts, because the composer documentation is very rich in explanations you can see it <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md" target="_blank">here</a>. If you read my <a href="https://reisraff.github.io/me/pt/post/1459191600" target="_blank">previous post</a> you should imagine that I am crazy about automation (laughs).

But I will give you a brief demonstration of how composer can make your life easier by automating tasks such as things you do before a commit or things like that.

Not too long, composer provides a scripts tag as well as some events like pre-install-cmd, post-install-cmd and more, you can see this in more detail when these events are fired, and more at this <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md" target="_blank">link</a>.

But you can also create custom scripts, below you can see a simple example:

`composer.json`

```json
{
    "scripts" : {
        "clearCache" : "rm -rf app/cache/*",
        "clearLogs" : "rm -rf app/logs/*",
        "clearBoth": [
            "@clearCache",
            "@clearLog"
        ]
    }
}
```

With these commands defined in composer.json we can execute them:

```bash
$ composer run-script clearCache
$ composer run-script clearLogs
$ composer run-script clearBoth
```

Simple, the first two commands will be executed separately. The third is an alias for the first two, in which case it will execute them one after the other.

I imagine with this overview you have already thought of thousands of things you can do with your composer projects. I hope I have helped, or at least created a curiosity for you to want to learn more about it.

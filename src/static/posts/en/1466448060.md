# Phulp

A few weeks ago I came across a problem and soon thought of how to solve it; Basically, I was using npm just to be able to install and use **gulpjs**. My project had (CSS, Js, HTML, etc.), was using **gulpjs** only to minify CSS, and JS, and to compile LESS, so I realized that I could save a little machine resource, and time. deploy doing all this with PHP only, so I created PHULP.

PHULP is nothing more than **gulpjs** ported to PHP. The main concept is the same, that is, it is a task manager or task runner (as other people say), focused on file handling, in this case for minification, compilation of LESS, SASS and so on. But it can be used as far as the imagination reaches.

There is a possibility to create plugins for PHULP just like gulpjs, there are already some created, you can see <a href="https://reisraff.github.io/phulp/dist/#!/plugins" target="_blank">here</a>.

# How to use

In the <a href="https://github.com/reisraff/phulp" target="_blank">github repository</a> there is a good documentation of how to use PHULP, but as a novelty, I will give a simple but real example of use.

## Installing in your project as a composer

We just need to execute the command:

```bash
$ composer require reisraff/phulp
```

## Writing PhulpFile.php

We will create a default task that will:
- iterate a directory;
- find only files ending with .php;
- print the file name on the terminal;
- and finally we will move the file to a destination directory;

```php
<?php

// Define the default task
$phulp->task('default', function ($phulp) {
    // Define the source folder
    $phulp->src(['src/', '/php$/'])
        ->pipe($phulp->iterate(function ($distFile) {
            \Phulp\Output::out($distFile->getName(), 'blue')
        }))
        ->pipe($phulp->dist('dist/'));
});
```

Running Phulp If you did not configure bin-dir in composer:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/phulp
```

**Done!**

In addition to finding and moving files, PHULP comes with some features in the core itself, such as:

- clear a specific directory;
- watch from some directory;
- match regular expression files;
- create multiple tasks (tasks);
- and so on (go to <a href="https://github.com/reisraff/phulp" target="_blank">repository</a> and explore the code).

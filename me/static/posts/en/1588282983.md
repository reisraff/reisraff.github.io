# Do I need time?

I don't think so!

### TLDR; (Too long don't read)

During this time I get to organize my ideas and made interesting things to free my mind of an excessive neurons burn. Yeah, when I study something new and difficult a lot, I kind of go into an overclocked processor state along with saturated memory; I can't do more than I can, I have a limit.

So I decided to do different things, and take on responsibilities that are easier to fulfill.

I leave it down there at random, and explaining / describing it a little bit one by one.

The <a href="https://reisraff.github.io/me/en/byte-off" target="_blank">Server Byte Off</a> was created by me, with the purpose of making a knowledge exchange community, it would be really nice to have you there, because there are a lot of nice people, and with plenty of knowledge. Perhaps needing a comment from you, as they may not know what you know. It seems a bit rhetorical but this is how it works, not everyone has 100% knowledge.

I created a fullstack framework in python with the help of a friend, it's named <a href="https://github.com/phoopy/phoopy" target="_blank">Phoopy</a>, this framework is based on PHP Symfony, divides subprojects into what I call the Bundle, and has a great approach for injecting dependencies.

Among the things this guy can do I list the most important ones like: built-in Http Server, Script Console Manager, Dependency Injection, etc.

Yes, that's right, I'm teaching a course on the <a href="https://www.mentebinaria.com.br" target="_blank">Mente Bin√°ria</a> channel the course is on the playlist on this link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PONfAT7HWbE&list=PLIfZMtpPYFP5KtmvkFREP-Kn1WAwslIJx" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PONfAT7HWbE&list=PLIfZMtpPYFP5KtmvkFREP-Kn1WAwslIJx</a> and there is a game repository on github at this link <a href="https://github.com/reisraff/2d-platform-demo" target="_blank">https://github.com/reisraff/2d-platform-demo</a>, it is a project that I am very fond of doing, because it is something very pleasant.

### <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/eo6hvj/great_things_are_coming/" target="_blank">Making my own game</a>

It's still in the oven, but soon it comes out, this game I'm doing will be something similar to SMM (Super Mario Maker) but it will be free, and multi-platform, that's the idea, after all I'll use my own assets ( drawings, music, art, etc.) and already have a straw in the link below <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/eo6hvj/great_things_are_coming/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/eo6hvj/great_things_are_coming/</a>. Even if you know how to make the drawings, send me DM.

### Personal things, but cool.

I put the title like this because it is for personal use, for documentation, and use, but I made it public.

The First is a project with binaries that streamline the use with a lot of containers, which I use in my research and games with CTF, the link is <a href="https://github.com/reisraff/docker" target="_blank">https://github.com/reisraff/docker</a>

And The second is a research project (basic but important things) where I document exploiting binaries, with techniques such as (Format String, Memory leak, ROP, etc.) that bypass vulnerabilities such as (Buffer Overflow, Heap Overflow, Format String, etc.). You can find the link below <a href="https://github.com/reisraff/0x00" target="_blank">https://github.com/reisraff/0x00</a>


Maybe there were more things in the meantime that I didn't write, but I don't remember, but that doesn't mean I don't have time to remember;)

Stay with God.

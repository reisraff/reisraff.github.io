# 1st Post - What to say?! o.O

Good dawn! 'cause now it's 2a.m, and I am thinking what to write in the next paragraph.

Well, it is now time! I had to start to write and put some of my stuff available to the worldwide.

### What is this?

hmm... It appears to be something like a blog, a place to express yourself of tons of way, but the coolest thing is that this blog is a merge of things hehe, I just used the <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> to serve its application, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">MarkDown</a> as syntax, (Then you think: "but why not the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>"; No, I just think that I wanted to do a frankestein), "back to the subject" I used <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJs</a> as the main framewrok, and a library to transform the MarkDown to HTML that is the <a href="https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown" target="_target">ShowDown</a>.

Well, this is just the beginning, I was crazy to finish to be able to write the first post soon, but I will still implement many things, such as commenting, replying, sharing, and obviously, I will restructure what is already done.

My personal webpage and this frankestein doing the "blog" is opensource and the coolest thing is that it is all static (Obviously that has some automation), you can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/reisraff/reisraff.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.

I think that is it, if you liked or not hehehe, you can send me a tt meanwhile, until I have implemented the comments.

See ya in the next post.

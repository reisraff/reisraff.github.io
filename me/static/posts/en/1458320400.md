# Working tools

This theme often turns out to be a nice discussion at work, because many use the same tools as you, others prefer other tools and from there we start to improve our argument techniques, sometimes we test the tool that colleague indicated, sometimes we end up exchanging our tool for his in the end.

I am a person who I like to try new tools, so if you indicate me one for sure I want to know a little more about it, but not prolonging the post, the tools I use day to day are:

#### <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime</a>

In the old days I used IDE, after I discovered this text editor I started to use only it, I started to use the free version, and after a while that had already gotten like I bought the license of version 3.

#### <a href="http://gnometerminator.blogspot.com.br/p/introduction.html" target="_blank">Terminator</a>

As I use linux one of the tools I use the most is the terminator, it is a different terminal, it has some nice features, like you can make the background transparent, split the terminal in two, and even create groups for each division of the terminal, can broadcast each letter you type.

#### <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>

My favorite browser for both web and personal development, I don't have much to talk about.

#### <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a>

After this tool came to market, I imagine that any team, not necessarily being in development, started using it, is a great team communication tool.

#### <a href="http://www.skype.com/" target="_blank">Skype</a>

But before Slack existed Skype was very successful, I believe it will continue to do so, and I will continue to use it.

#### <a href="https://keep.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Keep</a>

This tool saves my life, I always forget some command in linux, or something else, and whenever that happens, I create a reminder in Google Keep.

#### <a href="https://drive.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>

I couldn't help putting Google Drive, it's a great tool that made me sell all my external hard drives.

#### <a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">Pocket</a>

I know a little while, but I liked it a lot and by the way I'll never stop using it, is a very cool tool for those who like to scour the web save interesting things to see later.

#### <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a>

Trello is a great tool for developers, it's simple to use, it's free, and it helps a lot in organizing tasks.

If I have not forgotten any of these, all I recommend, but as I said, if you use any that "can" replace any of these and want to tell me feel free.
